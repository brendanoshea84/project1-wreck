A centeral website to show and advertise the band "Pontus Snibb's Wreck of Blues."
This website for the band "Pontus Snibb's Wreck of Blues," at current, the BAND has allot of content on many other sites. This website should provide a central location so viewers can observe, example and interact with the band.

## UX

This website should help prosective clients to sample the band by highlighing their preformance, reviews and keep viewers up-to-date with coming shows.
The band at this moment uses spotify, youtube and facebook as their main out-sourcing of their material. This site should help centralise their material, insuring easier access for viewers under one site.

The band has their own style which this site tries to keep similar and also using a stark contrast with orange to highlight and pop important information. 
As the band already has allot of internet sources, this site centralises these sites and also provides quick links. Therefore while this site has the majority of highlights, it incourages viewers to also view their other source material.
