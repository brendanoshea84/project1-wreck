# Pontus Snibb's Wreck of Blues

First Milestone project for Code Institute: User-Centric- Frontend Development.

A centeral website to show and advertise the band "Pontus Snibb's Wreck of Blues."
Currently the band has a lot of content on many different sites and this website should provide a central location so viewers can observe, example and interact with the band.

## UX

 This website should help prospective clients to sample the band by highlighing their performance, reviews and keep viewers up-to-date with coming shows. At the moment the band uses spotify, youtube and facebook as their main out-sourcing of their material. This site should help centralize their material, insuring easier access for viewers under one site.

The band has their own style which this site tries to keep similar and also using a stark contrast with orange to highlight and pop important information. As the band already has a lot of internet sources, this site centralizes these sites and also provides quick links. Therefore while this site has the majority of highlights, it incourages viewers to also view their other source material. Photos from these other sources has been given permission from Pontus Snibb to use on this site.

## Features

### Introdustion 
The site opens to a strong welcome page of the band with a quote, in swedish, from Pontus Snibb. An eye catching "latest News" in a contrast of orange against the soft blue, highlights the next gig and their lastest song. Both these links will open new appropriate pages to find/sample the latest the band has been working on.

### Tour Shows 
The bands next gigs/shows posters and while hovering over it will increase the scale for easier to read. Also a quick link to their facebook page for more detailed information on their shows.

### Music 
An embeded spotify player which plays their current album. The spotify player allows for 30sec of samples before asking to join spotify for free, or if already a member a quick access to Wreck of blues. A slide show provides news articles on the band performances and reviews.

### Video 
Youtube embedded player that shows a live 12min performance of the band. This shows the skills and the interaction of the band towards the audience. A show case if viewers would hire the band for private parties or gigs.

### Future Includions
